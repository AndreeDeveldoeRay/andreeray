// TODO: instead of strings use arrays with objects containting records
// a record could look something like
// {
//  commands: ['sdfg']
//  records: [n,...n]
// }
//
// and then the records would have its own meta data
//
// {
//  text: 'bla bla',
//  markup: '<p>'
// }
//
//  This would better the application greatly, by several facors, for example.
//  We can render html markup by looking at the html propery, this would speed up
//  the process of render html markup, since it would not have to animate it anymore.
